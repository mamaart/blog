Hi.. I am Martin. I have a lot of interest in software, network and computer stuff.

I made this blog as a way to write about some of the technologies that interest me. I often work on a lot of different projects, and then I move on and forget about something I have worked on. So I think this blog is a good way to go back sometimes and remember what I was doing and what I learnt (because sometimes I forget).

I also have some ideas for project I didn't start working on, and I think this is a good place to start building on those ideas (by writing), instead of just implementing them directly.

At the moment I have a lot of interest in netlink, I specifically want to build on the wifi capabilities in the Go library mdlayher/wifi. This requires me to learn about the nl80211 api in the linux kernel and to read a lot of C, which is not my preffered language.

My favourite language is probably Go, because of the simplicity, and I was using it a lot the last 3 years. However, I am learning Rust at the moment, and I really like the safety it gives. I also used python a lot for different things, but especially webscraping. I learned Haskell which I really enjoy and I am having fun playing with it by solving code challenges, but I havent found any use for it in real life yet.

I enjoy webscraping beause it gives me a lot of power over data on the internet, and I mostly implement the scrapers in python because it is easy and fast. Then when I need to make the application more robust, I translate it into Go. I made some nice project with webscraping and I think I will write about them here. 

Even before I started programming I was working with servers as a hobby, and I was trying to setup a mail server, databases and web servers with simple web applications. During my education I was always hosting all our projects, and my home environment has developed a lot since. Some big transitions was when I moved from libvirt to docker, and when I started doing devops with drone, still on docker. and the latest big change was when I decided to move all my deployments to kubernetes and doing CD with ArgoCD instead of shell scripts. (I had a lot of downtime doing that transition). My dream now is to have the whole infrastructure as code using Ansible, Terraform, Nixos or a mix. and have multiple backups and a lot of security. I also want to learn more about OpenStack.

Here is some more things that I might write about:
- Yew (rust)
- NixOS
- Rsync on android
- Server stuff 
- Linux
- Neovim Nixvim Vim Vi and plugins
- Authorization systems
- Encryption systems
- webscraping
- small tools
- Messaging applications
- IOT Projects 
- Game development (Multiplayer over network)
- Quic protocol
